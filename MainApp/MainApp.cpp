  // - A slot remains a normal c++ function, so you can call it yourself
  // - A single signal can be linked to different slots
  // - A single slot can be called by different linked signals
  // - A connection can be made between a signal and a slot from different objects,

  // To connect a signal to a slot their methods' signature must much
  // Signal and slots never return values
